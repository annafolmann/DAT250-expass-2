# Expass 3 

When starting this assignment, everything went fine and I managed to create and vote on my poll on http://localhost:5173/. 

But when I started step 4, things started to fall apart. When running backend and frontend in seperate terminal, things went smoothly until I tried voting in the polls. This is when the page just turned white. I was able to make the polls, but not vote at them. And after several error searches in both backend and frontend, the issue appeared that I need to make an update on my computer. Since the computer is old, and I have not very much space, the software is outdated compared to what I should have when running my code. The computer estimates that to take around 10 hours - which I do not have until the deadline. Therefor I chose to just to add the code I had, which should work when update my computer. 

But then, my second issue occured. When trying to add my project to github; I was not allowed to upload it due to too many files. Which I thought was weird. Also, I have never operated with github, so I am unfamiliar with the system and how I should use it. After doing some research i tried pushing the files to my "StandardApplication" within the terminals. I then had to add my username and password by making a token. This worked, but my last issue was that since I have ReadMe file within the "frontend" file, and github therefor rejects my push. Since I am not familiar with github, I do not know how to solve this and frankly need some help with how github works and should be used. 

As a crisis solution, I uploaded my frontend files that I was allowed to upload, and wrote this to explain why it looks like a mess. 

I will be in lecture tomorrow, and ask for help and tips. And before that, I will upload my computer and have it ready.
