# Expass 3 

When starting this assignment, everything went fine and I managed to create and vote on my poll on http://localhost:5173/. 

But when I started step 4, things started to fall apart. When running backend and frontend in seperate terminal, things went smoothly until I tried voting in the polls. This is when the page just turned white. I was able to make the polls, but not vote at them. And after several error searches in both backend and frontend, the issue appeared that I need to make an update on my computer. Since the computer is old, and I have not very much space, the software is outdated compared to what I should have when running my code. Also, I needed to update my VS code by deleting it, and downloading it again. This took me 5 hrs. 

After doing the update and reinstallations, I managed to do the rest of the tasks. 

In my repository the files are kind of messy, due to that I am not very familiar with github and therefor tried to add my files by add the files directly. I was not allowed to add all my files, and therefor understood that I needed to push my project into github. Which I managed at the end.
